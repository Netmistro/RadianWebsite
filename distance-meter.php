                The 2-in-1 Laser Tape Measure combines two accurate measuring tools into one product. It is a 50 ft.
                laser distance measurer with a 16 ft tape measure and is a one-hand, one-person operation. Now you can
                quickly and easily get both long distance measurements and short-span precision from the same tool!
                Everything you need is in the palm of your hand with the General Tools 2-in-1 Laser Tape Measure.

                General Tools TS01 100’ Bluetooth Connected ToolSmart Laser Distance Measure is designed to replace a
                conventional tape measure. The TS01 is faster, safer and more accurate than a conventional tape measure.
                It takes much less time and only one hand to hold the tool against a wall, aim at the opposite wall and
                press the button than it does requiring both hands to secure one end of a conventional tape measure,
                walk the other end to the far wall, write down the reading and retract the tape. The TS01 offers
                advanced features, like an area function that provides the square footage of a room or wall so you can
                easily estimate the amount of paint, flooring, tiles, or other materials needed to complete your
                project. The laser measure also can act like a digital tape measure that offers real-time, continuous
                measurement. Its large, backlit screen is easy to read from all angles and saves and displays the last
                four measurements taken.

                <li>Excellent Portability to You - A tape measure and other measuring devices can be heavy and slow you
                    down. Our unit features a mount for a lanyard and weighs just 60g without batteries, making it
                    barely noticeable when carried with you. A hard plastic cover and a hard rubber grip protect the
                    unit from wear and tear and allow it to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand.
                </li>
                <li>Always Right Measurement - Don’t let inaccurate measurements disturb your workflow or your next
                    project. Suaoki’s laser distance meter is accurate to within a 1/12inch (+/- .078 in), which ensures
                    you receive a proper measurement each time. Plus, it features 4 unit measurements (m/ft/in/ft+in) by
                    long press the button and a slot to accommodate a tripod (not included), which allows you to make
                    the unit even more accurate.
