                Measuring a distance shouldn’t have to be a hassle. Suaoki’s digital laser distance meter quickly
                measures your distance with a push of a button and displays the last three measurements on screen for
                any further calculations, which is making it faster than a tape measure since you don’t need two people
                or to walk from one side to another.

            <h3>Product Description:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Excellent Portability to You - A tape measure and other measuring devices can be heavy and slow you
                    down. Our unit features a mount for a lanyard and weighs just 60g without batteries, making it
                    barely noticeable when carried with you. A hard plastic cover and a hard rubber grip protect the
                    unit from wear and tear and allow it to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand.
                </li>
                <li>Always Right Measurement - Don’t let inaccurate measurements disturb your workflow or your next
                    project. Suaoki’s laser distance meter is accurate to within a 1/12inch (+/- .078 in), which ensures
                    you receive a proper measurement each time. Plus, it features 4 unit measurements (m/ft/in/ft+in) by
                    long press the button and a slot to accommodate a tripod (not included), which allows you to make
                    the unit even more accurate.
                </li>
                <li>Note:
                    Caution for Laser Radiation: This is a class 2 laser product (human accessible power output: <1mW),
                    for protecting your eyes, please do not stare into the beam or view directly with optical
                    instruments.
