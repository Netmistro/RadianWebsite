                        The Elcometer range of Protective Coatings Inspection Kits provide all the tools required for
                        onsite
                        inspection of a coating, including surface profile, dewpoint, relative humidity, adhesion and
                        both
                        wet and dry film thickness.</p><br>
                    <p>
                        Available as metric or imperial kits and housed in a sturdy, light-weight carry case, Elcometer
                        Protective Coatings Inspection Kits are invaluable to the operator in the field to ensure the

                        The Elcometer 500 Coating Thickness Gauge accurately measures the thickness of coatings on
                        concrete and other similar substrates* - non destructively.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Fast and accurate, the Elcometer 500 Coating Thickness Gauge takes repeatable and reproducible
                        dry film thickness measurements of coatings on concrete up to 10mm‡ thick – without damaging the
                        coating.

                    <p>
                        Taking over 60 readings per minute in standard mode and 140+ readings per minute in scan mode;
                        the Elcometer 500 Coating Thickness Gauge allows users to inspect more coatings in less time.
                        With a choice of intelligent, ergonomic probes, designed for continuous use and field
                        replaceable probe tips you can inspect all day, everyday.

                    <p>
                        The built in signal strength indicator on the Elcometer 500 Coatings on Concrete Gauge prevents
                        false or incorrect readings, as the gauge only displays the coating thickness measurement if the
                        signal strength indicator goes green.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Robust, ergonomic and sealed against dirt and water, equivalent to a rating of IP54, the
                        Elcometer 500 Concrete Coating Thickness Gauge has been designed to work in harsh environments.
