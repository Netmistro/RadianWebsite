    <h1>Scaffold Engineering Design</h1>
    <p>
        RADIAN H.A. Limited offers an Engineering Design capability for all our clients upon request. The request is
        routed from in-house to our UK based partners, SCAFTEC. With over 100 years of combined experience within the
        scaffolding industry, we can offer our clients a cost effective design solution to meet their specific needs.
        All designs are designed, checked and approved by engineers with the knowledge, competence and expertise of
        scaffolding and design. Designs usually take about 5 (five) working days which starts when all information
        pertaining to the scaffold is provided by the client.
    </p><br>
    <h3> Typical Areas where Engineering Design is required</h3>
    The typical areas that we cover include the following: -
    <ol>
        <li>Formwork & falsework design</li>
        <li>Petro-chemical & offshore scaffolds</li>
        <li>Fa√ßade retention / shoring</li>
        <li>Temporary Roofs</li>
        <li>All System scaffolds</li>
        <li>Advertising banner supports</li>
        <li>Events (e.g. ramps, temporary stage etc...)</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>Typical requirements to complete an Engineered Design</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Structural steel plan of the layout where the scaffold is to be constructed. This would include all elevations
         and plans associated with the area where the scaffold is to be installed
        </li>
        <li>In order to comply with Eurocode, the client need to provide the fundamental value of basic wind velocity as
            10 minutes mean wind velocity irrespective of wind direction and time of year 10m above ground having
            probabilities of exceedance of 0.02 which is equivalent to mean return period of 50 years. If this is not a
            consideration, the design can still be done but will not be in compliance with Eurocode.
        </li>
        <li>Typical size of scaffold and a basic sketch of what is required and type of scaffold</li>
        <li>Photos of the general area where the scaffold is to be erected</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>What constitutes a Design?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Typically, with every design a full set of drawings/drawing is provided depending on the complexity of the
            scaffold structure
        </li>
        <li>Additionally, a set of calculations is also provided checking each of the members of the structure</li>
        <li>A bill of materials (BOM) can be provided upon request</li>
    </ol>
