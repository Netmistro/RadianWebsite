            <h2>About RADIAN H.A. Limited</h2><br>
            <h2>Company Overview</h2>
            <p>Radian H.A. Ltd. is a dynamic, customer-driven business established 14th March 2001; we primarily engage
                in the provision of comprehensive training programs in Scaffolding & Form Work. We work in conjunction
                with <b>Safety & Access Ltd. (UK)</b> the leading scaffolding & formwork training agency in the United
                Kingdom.
                We also provide the broadest range of Scaffolding, Scaffolding Tools, Scaffolding Accessories and
                Safety Equipment in Trinidad & Tobago for both hire and sale. Radian H.A. Ltd also has a truly unique
                market position as we never undertake any contract work, which we would consider to be direct competition
                with on-site contractors, many of whom are our customers.</p><br>
            <h2> Mission Statement </h2>
            <p>“At Radian H.A. Limited we are committed to being a company that provides unprecedented service and quality

                unique one stop service for our clients. Clients can be assured that the quality of all our training,
                materials, tools and gears meet and comply with international standard requirements.”</p><br>

                well as constantly developing the scaffolder capacity through our training regime and to constantly strive

            <h2>Our History & Partnerships</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Radian HA Limited</b> was established in 2001 to provide international training and consultancy services
                to the
                Construction and Petro-Chemical industries. We are a dynamic, customer-driven business with our clients’
                interest at the core of everything that we do. At Radian we have a passion for raising the industry’s
                standards, locally and regionally while adhering to international standards.
                Radian has an ongoing partnership with <b>Safety & Access</b> one of the UK’s leading <b>CISRS</b>
                Scaffolding training and Health and Safety consultancy provider. We have established a new partnership with
                <b>GETMIE Safe (UK)</b> to specialize in Rescue and Working at Heights training which allows us to provide
                expert training that will develop local and regional scaffolders to meet recognised international standards.
                The core model we have been implementing for the last 18 years, is the British Standard, which encompasses,
                European, American,
                Canadian and Australian standards. By the adoption of the British standard (BS EN12811-1:2003 AND TG20:13
                and SG 4:15 guides) we are hoping to enhance our Bureau of Standards and OSHE programs.
                Radian is also in association with <b>Leach’s (UK)</b>, the exclusive distributors of Nailspan® and IMN®
                professional range of scaffolding tools and the ever-expanding range of <b>BIG BEN®</b> safety products. In
                providing the training, tools, gears, and materials required for the scaffolder, our goal is to create a
                highly skilled individual that can work regionally and internationally. Radian understands the importance of
                implementing this standard, as we are aspiring to enhance the quality of equipment and management within the
                industry.
                We are also a proud member of the following: Energy Chamber of Trinidad and Tobago and the Trinidad and
                Tobago Contractors Association. As the Scaffolding industry continuously moves forward, Radian HA Limited is
                committed to taking scaffolding to new dimensions with our unique one stop service approach, partnerships,
                and memberships.
