    <h1>Rescue Training</h1>
    <p>
        Rescue is a crucial element in working at height or confined spaces projects and achieving a successful rescue
        in the minimum time is paramount. Rescue plans and systems should be designed to facilitate the rapid recovery
        of a person needing assistance. In order to do this, you must have the proper equipment and training. Simplicity
        is the basis of our rescue and evacuation systems.

    <p>RADIAN H.A. Limited provides rescue training using the Getmie Safe Rescue System. </p>
    <p>The training covers the following areas: -</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Evacuation from height â€“ this is ideal for tower cranes, hanging scaffolds & other tall structures</li>
        <li>No risk rescue of suspended persons - this includes using one of our devices with the telescopic pole</li>
        <li>Advanced rescue of suspended persons - this includes descending to the casualty & raising or lowering them
        </li>
        <li>Harness and Lanyard training - the safe use of equipment including correct fitting, safe practices, pre-use
            checks & maintenance/care of equipment
        </li>
