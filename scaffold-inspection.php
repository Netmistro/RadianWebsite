    <h1>Scaffold Inspection</h1>

    <p>
        By law all scaffolds must inspected prior to use and then inspected every 7 days thereafter or following adverse
        weather conditions. These inspections must be carried out by a ‘competent person’. In the majority of cases the
        scaffolder that erected the scaffold is deemed to be the ‘competent’ person to inspect his own scaffold. While
        this may have been the case in the past, companies are moving away from this and turning towards independent
        inspection.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        It is possible while working on a busy site with other sub-contractors around things can go wrong, things can be
        missed out. Assurance is needed by the client that the scaffold erected, is sound, sturdy and compliant. Our
        team of inspectors certify scaffolding according to the TG20:13 guideline, which is the latest and most widely
        used scaffold guidance.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Our Independent Scaffold Inspection Service allows a client or contractor the peace of mind to know that the
        scaffold is being inspected for use regularly, effectively and in compliance with the latest and current
        standard.

    <h3>When does a scaffold need inspection?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>After erection or before first use</li>
        <li>After an earthquake or tremor</li>
        <li>High winds/storm/hurricane</li>
        <li>Significant modification to the scaffold</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
        All scaffolding inspection should be carried out by a competent person whose combination of knowledge, training
        and experience is appropriate for the type and complexity of the scaffold. Competence may have been assessed
        under the CISRS or an individual may have received training in inspecting a specific type of system scaffold
        from a manufacturer/supplier.
