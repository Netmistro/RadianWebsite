            <p>
                This set is well suited for the homeowner who wants to build a tower over 20' and is okay with a heavier
                frame. The benefit to using this set over using the 5' X 5' set is cost. A 20' tower can be built with
                three sets of 6'4" tall vs four sets of 5' tall, saving around $100 in material cost. The disadvantage
                to using this frame is the weight. The 6'4" tall set weighs approximately 10 lb heavier than the 5' tall
                set. Our 5' X 6'4" set meets and/or exceeds all OSHA regulations.The frames have three ladder rungs and
                uses our premium c-locks. To maximize the life and longevity of our scaffold sets we apply a high

            <p>
                What is an outrigger? It's a triangular bracket that clamps to the bottom of a scaffold tower or system
                to increase the base width, in order to increase the stability of the tower. Two very nice built-in
                clamps allow you to clamp the scaffold outrigger to the base tube of the scaffold, and the end has a
                tube that will accept either a level jack, socket leveler, or caster wheel. Very high quality in powder
                coated yellow. RADIAN also stocks a huge “Jumbo” outrigger for those that want to upgrade to the largest
                and very best.</p>
            <p>The duty rating has been dramatically upgraded by increasing the diagonal tube to the
                same size as a scaffold frame vertical. 1.625 in/42mm x .090 in/23 mm. We have also added another mid
                bar. Use this to increase the safety of your tower when increasing the height needed. Or use this when
                you want to increase the stability of your lower tower. This outrigger increases the base width by a
                whopping 5 full ft.</p><br>

                Our swivel jack is a solid-steel 24" threaded rod welded to base plate accept the
                T on the end of the threaded rod, allowing base plate to swivel. This allows for individual adjustment
                of each leg and on surfaces with too high a degree of incline for a level jack.</p>
            <p>
                Our swivel jack is a solid-steel 24" threaded rod attached to a swiveling base plate. Where a level jack
                is welded perpendicular to it's rod, the swiveling action of this unit allows setup on an inclined
                surface. Provides for individual adjustment of each leg to help create a level working platform.
                Precision square acme threads and a massive 9.5" wing-nut provides increased leverage for ease of
                adjustment under load. Finally this product is zinc galvanized for longevity.</p><br>
