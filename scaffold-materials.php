            <p>
                The Aluminium 450 “R” Beam has been the market leader in Europe and the UK for more than 15
                years. It provides significant time and cost savings across a whole range of scaffold structures.
                Suspended or mobile platforms, birdcages, protection-decks bridges or temporary roofs are ideal
                applications for the Aluminium 450 “R” Beam.</p>
            <p>
                The Aluminium 450 “R” Beam has been specifically designed to provide the highest possible
                UDL. The unique design allows connection direct to the node point between the diagonals, achieving
                maximum loading. This means, in most applications the lowest number of beams are required. If additional
                beams are quickly and simply joined together with straight connectors using fast action spring clips.

                The Cuplok Scaffolding System is versatile, safe and fast to erect. With its unique locking system,
                horizontal ledgers and transoms can be connected to the cups on standards in one simple action without
                the use of loose fittings. Cuplok can be erected in straight or circular configurations and can be used
                for both access and support applications.
            </p>
            <p>

                and flexible systems available.
